# Starting Out
# Random Distribution
- Marks may not always be equally distributed but, sometimes it may feel like the marks are randomly distributed. Depends on the exam that you are giving and the faculty who is checking the papers :p. But, if it were randomly distributed, this is what it would look like.

*shows the first random distribution plot after this*

- Now from this plot we can see that a few of our friends have scored really high, few have scored really low and most of us have scored in the between of the two. With this plot we are kind of getting a hang of how the data is distributed. However, this kind of one-to-one distribution is a little tricky to interpret if we have a lot more students in there. It will become difficult to tell how many have score high how many have scored low and we might want to know what range of marks are students scoring in.

*show the histogram plot*

- Now this presents a better representation of how many people are scoring what kind of marks. But, to be honest this distribution still does not mimick a real life distribution. I mean in a given class most people are average...no offense I am one of them and a few are below that average and a few are above that average. Let's take a look at that more closely.

*move to Normal Distribution curve*

Alright so now we are looking at this curve, which is a more realistic representation of how people perform on a test. Most people would score in the average range which is 55 - 65. Few would score exceptionally well and few would score disastorously low. This is called a normal distribution it is characterised by a bell shaped curve. This is the kind of distribution that you see everywhere in the world. For example how many of you here have been to a movie theatre? I think a whole lot of us, now the seats that are close to the screen are cheaper and the seats at the end are the costliest and the seats in the middle are well mid range price. What you might also notice that there a very few seats that cost a lot and a very few that cost the lowest and most seats are the mid range priced one and if you have tried booking a seat online you would see that most competition is in that range.

*move on to Mean*
From the plot of the normal distribution we see a characteristic feature here which is that the values tend to be centered around a particular value and then they sort of spread out from that value. This value is the mean value or the average value. The formal definition is that you sum all the observation and divide it by the total number of observations to get the mean value but, what really does the mean value tells us? It simply tells use the value around which the distribution is centered. In terms of probablity if you randomly sample a student out of these 50 students, his marks are expected to be equal to Mean. Now we won't go into probablities today but, it gives us a good perspective to understand mean.

*Look at plots of different subject marks*
Now if we look at these individual plots, we can see that we can make an interpretation of how the class is doing in an individual subject right for example from the distribution of marks for english, we can see that a lot of people are scoring good. That means on an average people are performing better in this subject. Now notice how I said **average** here as a metric to derive insights from the data distribution and so we kind of are getting a gist of statistics now. Let's explore how we can develop a combined understanding of this distribution of marks by using mean even further.

*Look at averages box plot*
Now from this plot we have tried to visualise the average of marks scored in different subjects. From this plot it is clear that the entire class is doing significantly well in English and performing poorly in Physics. Based on an analysis multiple insights can be derived such as the fact that the physics teacher is not doing a good job or the exam was tough. From the analysis we can form these hypothesis which give us a way forward to actions and decisions.

*move on to Median*
Just as Mean is a measure of how the data is centered we have another measure of centrality of data called Median now before we move onto median I would like to go over the normal distribution curve one more time. Now as we can see the data is centered around the mean value that is being depicted by this red line but, what if it wasn't the case.

*move on to left skewed data plot*
Now as you can see here, the data is centered at a different value then the mean, you can clearly see that the mean value is quite away from where the distribution is centered at. This is called skewness in the data. When encountered with skew data, mean might not be a good measure of centrality, in this case we switch to median.

*move on to STD*
Alright now we have a sense of centrality of the data. The points at which it is centered on and it is an insightful statistic but, another interesting statistic in this regard would be the standard deviation or variance of the distribution.

*change std parameter and show how it affects the spread of data*

*Quantiles, Percentiles and Outliers*

Explain mathematically what are Quantiles and Percentiles

Explanation of Quantiles and Percentiles - Usually they are used to provide certain guarantees. Like say you are a tuition teacher who is helping kids with physics because apparently they are scoring quite low then you would say that your success rate is 95 percentile which means that 95% of the students that attend your tuition class have a good score.

Explanation of Outliers - Considering Physics again, we might also have a superhero in our class who would've scored say 100 marks in physics where everyone is scoring quite less. At the same time in the subject of English where everyone has a considerably good score, we might have another superhero who is scoring 0 marks. These people are outliers.
